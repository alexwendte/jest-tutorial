# Welcome to our Jest Tutorial!

- open a terminal in the root of the repository (where package.json is) and run `npm i` to install jest and jest-in-case
- you can run the test cases by just typing `jest` or `jest --watch` in the terminal.
- jest is smart about finding where your tests are located to make you life easier. In our case, our test files are located in the same directory as the files are are testing but under a sub directory '\_\_tests\_\_'. As a convention, the test file should be named the same as the file you are testing
